Great! With 5 years of experience, interviewers will likely expect you to know **Node.js** deeplyâ€”not just the basics, but also how to use it in scalable, production-grade applications. Here's a comprehensive list of **Node.js topics** categorized into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** levels, covering what interviewers typically look for:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Beginner Level**
> *Expected for anyone starting with Node.js*

#### Core Concepts
- What is Node.js? (V8 engine, non-blocking I/O, event loop)
- Node.js Architecture
- Differences between Node.js and traditional server-side frameworks (like PHP)
- Blocking vs Non-blocking code
- Global objects (`__dirname`, `__filename`, `process`, `Buffer`, etc.)

#### Modules and NPM
- CommonJS vs ES Modules
- Creating and exporting modules
- Using built-in modules (e.g., `fs`, `path`, `http`, `os`)
- Installing and managing packages using NPM/Yarn

#### Asynchronous Programming
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/Await

#### File System
- Reading/writing files
- Directory operations
- Streams (basic)

#### Basic HTTP Server
- Creating a server using `http` module
- Sending responses and parsing requests
- REST basics (GET, POST, etc.)

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Intermediate Level**
> *Expected from developers with 2+ years of Node.js experience*

#### Express.js Framework
- Setting up a server with Express
- Middleware usage
- Error handling
- Routing and route parameters
- Request/response lifecycle
- Using body-parser, cookie-parser, cors

#### REST APIs
- CRUD operations
- Status codes and headers
- Input validation and sanitization

#### Middleware and Error Handling
- Custom middleware
- Error middleware
- `next()` and how middleware chains work

#### Working with Databases
- MongoDB with Mongoose or native driver
- PostgreSQL with Sequelize/Knex
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization

#### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- OAuth basics
- Session vs Token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Environment Management
- `.env` files
- `dotenv` package
- Config separation for dev/stage/prod

#### Testing
- Unit testing with Mocha/Jest
- Integration testing
- Mocking external APIs or DB calls

#### Error & Logging
- Winston, Morgan, Pino
- Global error handling
- Using `try/catch` effectively

---

### ðŸ”º **Advanced Level**
> *Expected from senior or lead-level Node.js engineers*

#### Node.js Internals
- Event loop phases and how it works (Timers, I/O callbacks, etc.)
- `libuv`
- Async Hooks
- Worker Threads vs Child Processes
- Memory leaks and profiling

#### Performance Optimization
- Clustering
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies (Redis)
- Lazy loading, pagination, query optimization

#### Security
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Helmet and other security middleware
- CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection protection
- API key management and secrets handling

#### Scalability and Deployment
- PM2 (Process Manager)
- Dockerizing Node.js apps
- Load balancing with Nginx
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Horizontal and vertical scaling

#### Microservices and Communication
- REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Event-driven architecture
- Service discovery and health checks

#### Advanced Patterns
- Middleware chaining and composition
- Dependency Injection
- Singleton, Factory patterns in Node.js
- Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture
- Rate limiting, throttling APIs

#### Real-time Communication
- WebSockets with `ws` or Socket.io
- Pub/Sub systems
- Notifications system

---

### ðŸš€ Bonus (Nice to Have)
- Serverless with AWS Lambda or Vercel
- Using TypeScript with Node.js
- Monorepo structures (e.g., Nx, Turborepo)
- GraphQL with Apollo Server
