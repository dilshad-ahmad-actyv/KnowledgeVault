## âœ… **Beginner Level (Foundations)**

### ðŸ”¹ Basics

- What is MongoDB? and its features

  - Non-relational, schema-less
  - Stores data in key-value pairs and supports nested documents
  - document-oriented NoSQL database
  - MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON).
  - Each document is a record, and a `Collection` is a group of related documents.
  - Designed for distributed systems
  - Flexible Schema:
    - Each document in a collection can have different fields. You can insert documents with different structures in the same collection.
    - Collections are schema-less: documents within the same collection can have different fields or structures.
  - Horizontal Scaling:
    - MongoDB supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple machines (clusters).
    - Breaks large data into chunks and spreads across shards.
  - Replication (High Availability):
    - MongoDB uses replica sets to ensure fault tolerance. One node acts as primary, others are secondaries that sync and take over if the primary fails.
  - Transactions (Multi-document ACID):
    - Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions like relational DBs.
  - File Storage (GridFS):
    - Store and retrieve large files (like videos, images, PDFs) in chunks over 16MB using GridFS.
  - Security:
    - Includes authentication, authorization (RBAC), TLS/SSL encryption, auditing, IP whitelisting.
  - MongoDB Atlas:
    - Fully-managed cloud version of MongoDB. Offers scaling, backups, monitoring, and global clusters out-of-the-box.
    - No server setup needed â€” launch in minutes.

- JSON vs BSON

  - BSON stands for Binary JSON. It is the internal data format MongoDB uses to store documents on disk and in memory.
  - Why BSON, not plain JSON?:
    - Enables fast serialization/deserialization.
    - Faster and smaller: BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents.
    - Supports more data types than JSON (like Date, Binary, ObjectId, Decimal128, etc.).
    - Efficient traversal and indexing: MongoDB can quickly scan BSON for queries.

- Difference: MongoDB vs RDBMS (SQL vs NoSQL)

âœ… MongoDB Architecture (High-level Overview)
ðŸ”¹ Components:
`mongod` â€“ The core MongoDB server process (handles requests, CRUD, replication, etc.).
`mongos` â€“ The router in a sharded cluster (routes queries to the correct shard).
`Mongo Shell` or `MongoDB Compass` â€“ Tools to interact with MongoDB.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Flow:
Client sends a query (insert, update, etc.).
mongod receives it and performs operation (read/write).
If sharded, mongos determines which shard to route to.
If replicated, operation is written to primary, and then synced to secondaries.

                      |
               +-------------+
               |   Primary   | <--- write/read

### ðŸ”¹ MongoDB Data Model

- BSON vs JSON
- Documents and Collections
- Data types in MongoDB
- Schema design basics
- Naming conventions and indexing best practices
- how data is stored and queried internally?
- Embedding (denormalization) - Store related data within a single document.
- Referencing (normalization) - Store related data in separate documents.

| Term           | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Schema**     | The structure/shape of your documents.                   |
| **Document**   | A record in MongoDB (like a row in SQL, stored as BSON). |
| **Collection** | A group of related documents (like a table in SQL).      |

### ðŸ”¹ CRUD Operations

- `db.collection.insertOne()` / `insertMany()`
- `find()` with filters and projections
- `updateOne()`, `updateMany()`, `$set`, `$inc`
- `deleteOne()`, `deleteMany()`
- Query Operators: `$gt`, `$lt`, `$gte`, `$lte`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$nin`, `$or`, `$and`, `$regex`, `$exists`, `$not`, `$nor`, `$expr`, `$rename`, `$unset`, `$push`, `$pull`
