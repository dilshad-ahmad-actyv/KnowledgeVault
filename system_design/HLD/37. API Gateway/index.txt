1. API Gateway vs Load Balancer
2. API Gateway 
    - Request Routing
    - API Composition (based on device eg. mobile or pc)
    - Auth/OAuth
    - Rate Limiting
        - Manage burst limit
        - API Throttling
        - IP based blocking
        - API Queues
    - Service Discovery
    - Request-response transformation
    - Response caching
    - Logging

3. If API Gateway is a Single entry point, how does it handles millions of requests per second?
4. Global DNS (AWS 53 route, Azure traffic manager, Akamai)
5. Reverse Proxy vs API Gateway vs Load Balancer
   - Reverse Proxy: A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more backend servers and forwards client requests to them. eg. NGINX, Apache
   - Load Balancer: A load balancer is a traffic distributor that spreads client requests across multiple instances of a service to improve scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.
   - API Gateway: An API Gateway is a single entry point for all external clients into your system, especially in microservices architecture.
