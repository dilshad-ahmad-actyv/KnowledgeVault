1. git diff <file> (View Unstaged Changes (Local Changes))
2. git diff --staged or git diff --staged <file>(for specific files) (View Staged Changes (Before Committing))
3. git diff <commit1> <commit2> -- <file> (View Changes Between Commits of a file)
4. git diff main..feature-branch (View Differences Between a Branch and Main, If you want to see how a branch differs from main)
5. git diff <commit> -- <file> (View Differences Between a Commit and Working Directory)
6. git show <commit> (View Changes in a Specific Commit)
7. git diff origin/main (Compare Changes with Remote Branch)
8. git diff --color-words <file> ( Show a File Difference in a More Readable Format)



In Git, you can view the differences between files using various commands depending on your needs. Here are different ways to see file differences:

---

### **1. View Unstaged Changes (Local Changes)**
If you want to see changes made to a file that haven't been staged yet:
```sh
git diff <file>
```
Example:
```sh
git diff index.js
```
This shows what has changed in the file compared to the last committed version.

---

### **2. View Staged Changes (Before Committing)**
To see the differences in files that have been added (`git add`) but not yet committed:
```sh
git diff --staged
```
or for a specific file:
```sh
git diff --staged <file>
```
Example:
```sh
git diff --staged app.js
```

---

### **3. View Changes Between Commits**
If you want to compare a file between two commits:
```sh
git diff <commit1> <commit2> -- <file>
```
Example:
```sh
git diff a1b2c3d 4e5f6g7 -- main.py
```

---

### **4. View Differences Between a Branch and Main**
If you want to see how a branch differs from `main`:
```sh
git diff main..feature-branch
```
This shows the differences between `main` and `feature-branch`.

---

### **5. View Differences Between a Commit and Working Directory**
If you want to compare a file from a specific commit to your current working directory:
```sh
git diff <commit> -- <file>
```
Example:
```sh
git diff 123abc -- app.py
```
This shows how `app.py` has changed since commit `123abc`.

---

### **6. View Changes in a Specific Commit**
To see the changes made in a particular commit:
```sh
git show <commit>
```
Example:
```sh
git show a1b2c3d
```

---

### **7. Compare Changes with Remote Branch**
To see the difference between your local branch and the remote branch:
```sh
git diff origin/main
```

---

### **8. Show a File Difference in a More Readable Format**
Use `--color-words` to show inline changes in words instead of lines:
```sh
git diff --color-words <file>
```
Example:
```sh
git diff --color-words README.md
```

---

### **9. View Differences Using a GUI Tool**
If you have a visual diff tool (like `meld`), you can use:
```sh
git difftool
```
or for a specific file:
```sh
git difftool <file>
```
Example:
```sh
git difftool styles.css
```

---

### **10. View Changes in a More Compact Format**
```sh
git diff --stat
```
This shows a summary of changes instead of the full details.
