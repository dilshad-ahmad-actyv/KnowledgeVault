### **What is `git cherry-pick`?**
`git cherry-pick` is a Git command that allows you to apply a specific commit (or multiple commits) from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

#### **Use Cases of `git cherry-pick`**
1. **Apply a Specific Fix from Another Branch**  
   - Suppose a bug fix exists in `feature-branch`, but you need it in `main`. Instead of merging the whole `feature-branch`, you can cherry-pick only that commit.
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```
   
2. **Backporting Fixes**  
   - If a critical fix was applied in `main` but also needs to be included in an older release branch (e.g., `release-v1.0`), `git cherry-pick` helps apply it there.

3. **Moving a Commit from One Branch to Another**  
   - If you accidentally committed to the wrong branch, you can cherry-pick the commit to the correct one and remove it from the wrong branch.

### **How `git rebase` Helps with `git cherry-pick`**
While `git cherry-pick` is useful, rebasing can sometimes **eliminate the need for cherry-picking**. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Avoid the Need for Cherry-Picking by Keeping Up-to-Date with `rebase`**
   - Instead of cherry-picking individual commits from `main` into your feature branch, rebasing can keep your branch in sync without unnecessary history clutter.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     git checkout feature-branch
     git rebase main
     ```
     This way, all updates from `main` are included in `feature-branch`, making cherry-picking unnecessary.

2. **Prevent Duplicate Commits**
   - If you cherry-pick a commit and later merge/rebase that branch into `main`, you might end up with duplicate commits.
   - Rebase helps maintain a clean history, ensuring no redundant commits appear.

3. **Rewriting History for Clean Cherry-Picks**
   - Before cherry-picking, you can use interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`) to clean up commits.
   - Example: If a commit includes unnecessary changes, you can split or squash it before cherry-picking.

### **When to Use Rebase vs Cherry-Pick**
| Scenario | Use `git rebase` | Use `git cherry-pick` |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Keep a feature branch up-to-date | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No |
| Apply only a specific commit to another branch | ðŸš« No | âœ… Yes |
| Avoid duplicate commits in history | âœ… Yes | ðŸš« No |
| Backport a fix to an older branch | ðŸš« No | âœ… Yes |

### **Example of Cherry-Picking a Commit**
1. Find the commit you want to apply:
   ```sh
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   a1b2c3d Fix login issue
   4e5f6g7 Add new feature
   ```
   
2. Cherry-pick the commit:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git cherry-pick a1b2c3d
   ```

3. If conflicts occur:
   - Resolve them manually.
   - Add resolved files:
     ```sh
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Continue:
     ```sh
     git cherry-pick --continue
     ```

4. Push the updated branch:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Summary**
- **`git cherry-pick`** is useful for applying specific commits to another branch without merging.
- **`git rebase`** helps keep branches up-to-date and avoids unnecessary cherry-picking.
- Use **rebase to maintain a clean history** and **cherry-pick for isolated fixes or backports**.
