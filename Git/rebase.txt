## Steps to Rebase in GitHub Using Command Line:

 1. **Ensure Your Local Repo is Up-to-Date**

git checkout main  # Switch to main branch
git pull origin main  # Get the latest changes


 2. **Switch to the Branch You Want to Rebase**

git checkout feature-branch


 3. **Rebase Your Branch onto Main**

git rebase main

- This applies your feature branch commits on top of the latest `main` branch.
- If there are conflicts, Git will stop at the conflicting commit and ask you to resolve them.

 4. **Resolve Any Conflicts (If Any)**
- Open conflicting files and fix issues.
- After resolving conflicts, stage the changes:
  
  git add <file>
  
- Continue the rebase process:
  
  git rebase --continue
  
- If you want to abort the rebase:
  
  git rebase --abort
  

 5. **Force Push the Updated Branch**
Since rebase rewrites history, you need to force push:

git push origin feature-branch --force

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Force pushing (`--force`) can overwrite history and cause issues for teammates working on the same branch.
