**************************************************************************************

You can open and view the contents of a file in the terminal using different commands depending on your needs:

### **1. View the Entire File**
- **`cat` (Concatenate & Display)**
  ```sh
  cat filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  cat index.js
  ```
  This prints the entire file content to the terminal.

---

### **2. View File with Pagination (If It's Too Large)**
- **`less` (Best for Large Files)**
  ```sh
  less filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  less largefile.log
  ```
  - Use `â†‘` and `â†“` to scroll.
  - Press `q` to exit.

- **`more` (Similar to `less`, but less powerful)**
  ```sh
  more filename
  ```
  - Press `Enter` to scroll line by line.
  - Press `q` to exit.

---

### **3. View File with Line Numbers**
- **`nl` (Numbered Lines)**
  ```sh
  nl filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  nl script.py
  ```

- **Using `cat` with line numbers**
  ```sh
  cat -n filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  cat -n data.txt
  ```

---

### **4. View Only a Specific Number of Lines**
- **First 10 Lines (`head`)**
  ```sh
  head filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  head -20 logs.txt  # Show first 20 lines
  ```

- **Last 10 Lines (`tail`)**
  ```sh
  tail filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  tail -30 error.log  # Show last 30 lines
  ```

- **Continuously Watch a File (`tail -f`)**
  ```sh
  tail -f filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  tail -f server.log  # Watch a live log file
  ```
  Press `Ctrl + C` to stop watching.

---

### **5. Search for a Specific Word in a File**
- **Using `grep`**
  ```sh
  grep "search-term" filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  grep "error" logs.txt
  ```
  - To ignore case:
    ```sh
    grep -i "error" logs.txt
    ```
  - To show line numbers:
    ```sh
    grep -n "error" logs.txt
    ```

---

### **6. Open a File in an Editor (Nano, Vim, VS Code)**
- **Nano (Simple Editor)**
  ```sh
  nano filename
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  nano config.json
  ```

  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  code app.js
  ```

### **7. View File Content in Hexadecimal (For Binary Files)**
```sh

```
Example:
```sh
